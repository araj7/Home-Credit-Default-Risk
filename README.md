# Home-Credit-Default-Risk
The goal of this project is to classify and predict the number of clients that can receive a 
loan. I classified people as clients who are to be granted a loan, and the ones who the
business would not lend to. This highlights the reliability or credibility of an applicant for
repayment of the loan and whether they can pay.
The problem in particular strikes as challenging to solve since this business works in an unusual
scenario where loans are to be granted to people that other banks would normally not consider,
given the low to zero credit score. Since their business model is focused upon granting loans to
individuals that other banks would demonstrably refuse, they are at a significantly higher
financial risk. As a result, the business would save by mitigating at-risk clients while yielding
profits by making use of the methods on the dataset to solve the issue at the highest possible
accuracy, comparatively more than they would gain without using the models.
Next, the data was cleaned and pre-processed in ways that made it suitable for use in various
modeling approaches.
The team convened to agree on the most appropriate way to prepare each predictor for each
potential modeling approach. With the data generally prepared, the team moved into an
exploratory modeling phase where each member attempted to fit and tune at least two types of
classification models using either all predictors or a subset of the data that had near-zero
variance and highly correlated predictors removed. This phase included using the predictive
classification methods like K-means clustering algorithms, logistic regression analysis, or
classification analysis such as decision trees to classify the population in no risk categories and
at risk categories considering data of each individual such as low credit score, family income as
variables of the model, credit card balance, previous applications.
We found predictive methods that work with the data to classify the people that can be granted
the loan, versus those who would pose a risk to the business, and therefore are to be rejected.

After exploring and comparing a breadth of predictive model types, there was also time
consuming preprocessing done to clean the dataset. The performance results of each model
were then considered in conjunction with the benefits and drawbacks of selecting each model in
the context of the project objectives.
